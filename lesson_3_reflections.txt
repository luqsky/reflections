When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I collaborates with other people or in the where I don't have my laptop, only internet connection on my phone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because we always wants the update in control, usually we just update on GitHub when the changes is confirm and no error. Other than that to save bandwidth( when you have limited bandwidth)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The main benefit is to keep the sync proses between local and GitHub can be done properly without any disorder. Beside that,if the conflict happen, git can resolve it with proper manner.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I will using email, messenger, and any available cloud services. It will more difficult to collaborate with GitHub because the others tools available not really focus for coding purpose. it is more for general use.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When there are different change in collaboration where the change is important. Time saving.
